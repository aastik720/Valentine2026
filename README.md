## 📖 About The Project

A fun, interactive, and adorable Valentine's Day proposal webpage that makes it impossible to say "No"! Perfect for asking your crush, partner, or loved one to be your Valentine in a unique and memorable way.

### 💡 The Concept

When the user tries to click "No":
- 📉 The **No button shrinks** with each click
- 🏃 The **No button runs away** from the cursor
- 📈 The **Yes button grows** bigger and bigger
- 💬 **Cute messages** appear begging them to say yes
- 🐻 An adorable **bear character gets sad**
- 💔 After 5 attempts, the **No button disappears** completely!

The only option left? **Say YES!** 💖
